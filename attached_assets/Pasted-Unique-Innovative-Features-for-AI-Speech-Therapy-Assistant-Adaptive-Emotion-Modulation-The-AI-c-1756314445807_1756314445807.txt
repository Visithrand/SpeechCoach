Unique & Innovative Features for AI Speech Therapy Assistant

Real-Time Lip & Mouth Movement Analysis – Using camera input, the system can guide users on correct lip and tongue positions for precise articulation.

Contextual Conversational AI – Simulate real-life scenarios (ordering food, phone calls, presentations) with dynamic conversation flows instead of pre-scripted exercises.

Augmented Reality (AR) Assistance – Overlay visual cues on screen for mouth position, tongue placement, or stress patterns.

Gamified Multiplayer Mode – Users can participate in speech games or competitions with peers remotely for motivation.

AI-Based Accent Harmonizer – Gradually adjusts and improves regional or foreign accents without making the speech unnatural.

Predictive Therapy Suggestions – AI predicts likely problem areas before the user speaks based on previous sessions and suggests proactive exercises.

Cultural & Contextual Speech Exercises – Tailors examples and exercises using local idioms, proverbs, or cultural stories to make practice relatable.

Biofeedback Integration – Use smart wearable data (heart rate, stress) to detect anxiety during speech and adjust therapy intensity or provide calming exercises.

Storytelling with Personality Development – Beyond pronunciation, the AI evaluates expression, clarity, confidence, and storytelling style, helping public speaking skills.
